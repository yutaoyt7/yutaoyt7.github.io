I am a 2nd year PhD student in Theoretical Computer Science at Northeastern University. I'm honored to be advised by **[Mahsa Derakhshan](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/derakhshan/)**.

My research interests lie in **online algorithms** and **graph algorithms**. A current line of my work focuses on **randomized greedy matching algorithms**, where I develop new analytical tools to better understand their behavior and performance in general graphs.
